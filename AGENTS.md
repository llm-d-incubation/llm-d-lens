# Repository development rules

## Default: focused changes

Start with the requested file or a targeted `rg` search. Read its implementation,
relevant callers and tests, then make the smallest compatible change. Reuse
existing code before adding abstractions or dependencies. Honor the user's stack.
Do not read the whole capability catalog, design library or all skills by default.
If the owner is unclear, search `.reuse/map.md` for the relevant entries only.

Ordinary features and fixes do not require task JSON, decision ledgers, semantic indexing,
duplicate scans, per-capability reports, full builds or service restarts.
Cross-module work needs affected-caller analysis and tests, not automatically a
formal audit. For requested reviews see [Repo review](.agents/skills/repo-review/SKILL.md);
run tests directly without automatic audit records.
Do not add helpers, frameworks, tests of trivial wiring or repeated documentation
just to satisfy a process. Explain non-obvious choices briefly; no mandatory plan
or decision table for a straightforward fix.

## Human approval for structural changes

- Do not create or delete code files without explicit human confirmation. This
  covers source, tests, scripts, migrations and executable configuration. A
  feature request authorizes behavior, not unstated file additions or deletions;
  describe the proposed paths and wait for approval before acting.
- Before changing `.gitignore`, assess the impact and obtain explicit human
  confirmation. Report what becomes ignored, whether tracked files, secrets,
  generated output or runtime data are affected, and any cleanup or migration
  required. A request to change ignore rules is not approval until that impact is
  explained and confirmed.

## Read only applicable contracts

Read the relevant sections of these skills when the change touches their contracts;
file location alone does not require reading every section or linked document.

| Change | Reference |
| --- | --- |
| React behavior, shared UI, charts | [UI](.agents/skills/ui/SKILL.md) |
| API, persistence, backend tasks, Kubernetes transport | [Backend](.agents/skills/backend/SKILL.md) |
| Startup, containers, CI, cluster lifecycle | [Deployment](.agents/skills/deployment/SKILL.md) |
| Schemas, DAOs, migrations | [Database](.agents/skills/database/SKILL.md) |
| Login, permissions, ownership, sessions, authenticated routes | [Auth](.agents/skills/auth/SKILL.md) |
| Explicit comprehensive review | [Repo review](.agents/skills/repo-review/SKILL.md) |

Keep domain rules in their domain; shared modules must not depend on pages.
For application file lifecycle changes, read [storage layout](docs/design/storage-layout.md).
Generated files, dependencies and runtime data are not implementation sources.
Fix catalog references when moving or removing a registered entry. Adding a feature
does not require catalog registration. Catalog expansion is explicit maintenance;
regenerate its map only when the catalog changes.

## Verification and decisions

Run affected checks once on final inputs. Reuse results in this session while
those inputs/dependencies remain unchanged; expand testing for shared contracts,
failures or uncertain impact. Report actual checks and limitations concisely.
`npm run verify:full` is a manual checkpoint, not the default for every task;
usage and limits are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#periodic-full-local-validation).
Read failed logs, not successful full logs. Stop when the requested behavior and
affected checks pass; do not expand a finished task into a repository review. Do not claim full validation from a
partial check or carry an old passing result across source/environment changes.

Continue clear authorized work. Ask only when business meaning, compatibility,
ownership or an exception remains unresolved after inspecting the relevant code.
Existing unresolved decisions still apply; never fabricate approval or delete
historical ledger entries to pass checks. Discuss new decisions in the conversation.
Commit only when requested. Before commits/PRs run `npm run check:english` over
the repository; PR titles/bodies must also pass `--text-file` checks. Fix findings
without hiding content or weakening checks. All repository text is English except
published translations under `docs/site/i18n/zh-CN/`.

## MCP tool catalog

A FastAPI route intended for Lens Assistant or MCP must declare an explicit
`operation_id`, `summary` and `description` on its decorator. After changing
backend routes, run `node scripts/generate-mcp-tools.mjs --check`; it validates
the Python catalog and fails on any unexpected skipped operation. Add UI-only,
internal, streaming, secret-bearing or otherwise unsuitable routes to
`intentionalSkips` in `apps/backend/src/llm_d_lens/mcp/definitions.json`.
The catalog implementation is `llm_d_lens.mcp.catalog`; special handlers are in
`llm_d_lens.mcp.tools`. No generated Node server artifact is required.

## Keep the docs site in sync

When updating published documentation, update every supported language version
in the same change (currently English and Simplified Chinese, as configured in
`docs/site/docusaurus.config.ts`). Keep corresponding pages, API examples and
UI instructions consistent; do not leave translations for a later task. This
applies to changes initiated in any language. Check the matching locale pages
for omissions before finishing; internal English-only design documents do not
require new translations.

Update docs for changed public behavior: user guides for page behavior, and the
matching module's REST/Python API tabs for changed endpoints or underlying public
callables. Pages live under `docs/site/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/`.
Private refactors do not require unrelated doc edits. `CONTRIBUTING.md` and marked
parts of `docs/design/agentic-deployment-design.md` are canonical sources for their
synced site pages; edit those sources, not generated copies.
Use `npm run docs:check` for local links; use `npm run docs:build` when rendering,
MDX, routes, anchors, site configuration or dependencies need validation.
Keep one canonical design per domain in `docs/design/`, with lowercase hyphenated
English filenames; update references when moving it. Avoid duplicate design docs.

## Hardware is profile-driven (never hardcoded)

Vendor labels, resource names, drivers, runtime images, telemetry and capability
gates come from `apps/backend/src/llm_d_lens/hardware/` profiles/providers, not
vendor branches or default GPU assumptions in consumers. Unknown hardware stays
neutral; never overwrite a user choice on discovery. See the
[hardware architecture](docs/design/hardware-plugin-architecture.md) for changes.
Per-resource configuration must be available in the UI, not only environment
variables. Keep create/edit behavior consistent.

## Local development

Use Vite hot reload. Restart only an affected service when necessary with
`scripts/lens-local.sh restart backend|server|frontend`; use `restart all` for
shared environment/ports or API changes requiring a new MCP catalog. Tooling and
documentation changes do not require application startup.
